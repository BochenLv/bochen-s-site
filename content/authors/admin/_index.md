I am currently doing research on deep learning, especially topics about adversarial robustness, under Prof. Zhanxing Zhu’s supervision. I am also highly interested in exploring the interdisciplinary possibilities between machine learning and physics. Previously, I attained my MA in Physics from Stony Brook University where I focused on string theory and other interesting topics of theoretical high energy physics with Prof. Warren Siegel’s guidance. Before that, I spent four wonderful years and did projects in quantum gravity at Sichuan University where I was a member of the ZhuFengJiHua.
